## Abstract
The growing number of constructs in behavioral research presents a problem to theory
integration, since constructs can not clearly be discriminated from each other. Recently
there have been efforts to employ natural language processing techniques to tackle the
problem of constructs that have different names but refer to the same phenomenon. This
paper compares the performance of different methods of determining semantic
document similarity and of different vectors space models on this construct identity
detection task. It also conducts an initial investigation into the usefulness of author
information. The results show that GloVe generally outperforms LSA on the given task
and LSA-trained document vectors perform better than any tested document projection
method, followed by unweighted word vector centroids. The author co-occurrence
information showed some limited utility when embedded as GloVe vectors.

Keywords: Construct identity fallacy (CIF), synonymy and polysemy, latent semantic
analysis (LSA), global vectors for word representation (GloVe), word embeddings,
document similarity
